# AIP Agent

### What is AIP?

**AIP (Agent Interoperability Protocol)** is the first **Web3-native multi-agent communication standard**, built by Unibase.  
It enables agents to easily connect, share memory, and collaborate across platforms, with secure on-chain identity and access control.

> AIP = MCP + On-chain Identity + Decentralized Memory

---

# ✨ Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Agent Interoperability**  
Seamlessly connects agents and tools across different ecosystems via MCP compatibility, gRPC, and SSE.

- **Decentralized Memory Layer**  
Agents store dialogues, knowledge, and configs in **Membase** for persistent, tamper-proof long-term memory.

- **On-Chain Identity & Access Control**  
Each agent has a blockchain-registered identity and programmable permissioning via BNBChain smart contracts.

- **Direct LLM Invocation**  
Agents and tools are natively callable by LLMs, enabling complex autonomous workflows.

# 🔥 Quick Start

## 1. Install AIP Agent SDK

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/unibaseio/aip-agent.git
```

Or clone locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unibaseio/aip-agent.git
cd aip-agent
uv venv
uv sync --dev --all-extras
```

## 2. Set Environment Variables

```bash
export MEMBASE_ID="<your unique agent ID>"
export MEMBASE_ACCOUNT="<your BNB testnet account>"
export MEMBASE_SECRET_KEY="<your secret key>"
```

Make sure your account has some BNB testnet tokens.

## 3. Run an Example Agent

```bash
cd examples/aip_agents
uv run grpc_full_agent_gradio.py
```

🎯 This starts a full-featured AIP agent with:

- Blockchain identity registration
- Memory Hub connection
- Live agent-to-agent or agent-to-tool interaction
